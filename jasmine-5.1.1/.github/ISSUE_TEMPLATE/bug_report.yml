        Thanks for taking the time to report a bug. Please follow these steps first.

        ## Troubleshooting
        Please take the time to rule out issues with your code or third party libraries before filing a bug report. If you are reporting an error, try to determine whether the error is coming from Jasmine, another library, or your own code.

        Check the [FAQ](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/faq.html) and any other relevant [documentation](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/docs_home.html) to see if your issue has already been addressed.

        ## Special troubleshooting steps for asynchronous scenarios
        If the issue has to do with testing asynchronous code, please read the [async tutorial](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/async) and the async section of the FAQ. In particular, check for the following common errors:

        * Are you trying to write a synchronous test for asynchronous code?
        * Does the test signal completion before the code under test finishes?
        * Do expectations run before the code that they're trying to verify?

        ## Try the latest version of Jasmine
        If at all possible, upgrade to the latest versions of `jasmine-core` and any other relevant packages (e.g. `jasmine`, `jasmine-browser-runner`). If you can't do that, please check the [release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/tree/main/release_notes) for all newer versions to make sure that the bug hasn't already been fixed.

        ## Put together a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
        Please help us help you by creating a minimal but complete setup that demonstrates the problem. Remove any code and libraries that aren't absolutely necessary, but make sure it doesn't depend on any code you haven't included. In many cases a simple code snippet is enough. In cases involving external libraries, *especially* Karma or Angular, we're likely to need a runable Git repository or jsbin/stackblitz/etc.

        **If we can't reproduce it, we can't fix it. Bug reports without a minimal, reproducible example are very likely to be closed.**
