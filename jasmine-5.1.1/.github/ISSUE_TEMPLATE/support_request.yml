        Jasmine is supported by volunteers working in their free time. Although we're generally willing to help, we're going to ask you to put in some effort first to help us help you.

        ## Troubleshooting
        Please take the time to rule out problems with your code or third party libraries before opening an issue. If you're running into an error, try to determine whether the error is coming from Jasmine, another library, or your own code.

        Check the [FAQ](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/faq.html) and any other relevant [documentation](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/docs_home.html) to see if your question has already been answered. Consider searching [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jasmine) and past issues in this repository for related questions as well.

        ## Special troubleshooting steps for asynchronous scenarios
        If the issue has to do with testing asynchronous code, please read the [async tutorial](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/async) and the async section of the FAQ. In particular, check for the following common errors:

        * Are you trying to write a synchronous test for asynchronous code?
        * Does the test signal completion before the code under test finishes?
        * Do expectations run before the code that they're trying to verify?

        ## Consider asking Angular questions in an Angular forum

        Questions like "how do I test this Angular service" are mostly about Angular, not Jasmine. You'll likely get better responses in an Angular forum. Here's a rule of thumb: If you can't demonstrate the problem without Angular, you probably have an Angular question.

        ## Try the latest version of Jasmine
        If at all possible, upgrade to the latest versions of `jasmine-core` and any other relevant packages (e.g. `jasmine`, `jasmine-browser-runner`).

        ## Put together a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
        Please help us help you by creating a minimal but complete setup that demonstrates the problem. Remove any code and libraries that aren't absolutely necessary, but make sure it doesn't depend on any code you haven't included. In many cases a simple code snippet is enough. In cases involving external libraries, *especially* Karma or Angular, we're likely to need a runable Git repository or jsbin/stackblitz/etc.
